This repository demonstrates a common but subtle bug in React Native's FlatList component.  The bug causes the FlatList to fail to update correctly when its data source is modified, leading to visual glitches and inconsistent data display.  The `bug.js` file shows the buggy implementation, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version. The key is properly managing the keys for each item in the FlatList to ensure efficient updates.
